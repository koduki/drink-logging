# **App Name**: Drink Logging

## Core Features:

- Sake Logging: Allow users to manually record information about a sake they have tried, including name, brewery, type, and rating. Also allow for recording of whiskey, beer and wine. Comments, time and location can also be recorded. Log information, like photos, can be public like on SNS, or the whole log or individual items can be set to private.
- Sake List: Display a list of logged sakes, sorted by date or rating. Also display whiskey, beer, and wine. Users can view their own lists and the lists of other users.
- Sake Rating: Provide a simple interface for users to rate each sake on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Also whiskey, beer and wine.
- Photo Upload with Visibility Control: Allow users to upload photos of their drinks and control the visibility of the photos (public or private).
- AI Scoring with Radar Chart: Use Gemini 2.5 Pro to score drinks based on aroma, sweetness, richness/body, acidity/freshness, complexity and aftertaste/finish and show them in a radar chart. The tool will also provide reasons for each rating.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted green (#A7C4A3) to evoke a sense of nature and tradition.
- Secondary color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) for backgrounds, providing a clean and simple look.
- Accent: Deep red (#8B0000) for interactive elements and highlights, drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese lacquerware.
- Clean and minimalist layout to ensure ease of use and readability.
- Use simple, line-based icons for sake types and other categories.
