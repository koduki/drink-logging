# Firebase App Hosting Backend Configuration

# Specify the runtime environment for your Next.js backend.
# Choose the Node.js version compatible with your project.
runtime: nodejs18 # Or nodejs20, etc.

# Define secrets to be securely fetched from Google Cloud Secret Manager.
# Ensure these secrets exist in Secret Manager in your GCP project
# and the App Hosting service agent has access permissions.
secrets:
  - name: GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY          # Name of the secret in Secret Manager
  - name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY # Name of the secret in Secret Manager

# Define environment variables available to the backend server process.
# These can be direct values or references to secrets defined above.
env:
  # --- Secrets from Secret Manager ---
  # The 'variable' name is how your code will access it (e.g., process.env.GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY)
  # The 'secret' name refers to the 'name' defined in the 'secrets' section above.

    secret: GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY

  - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY

  # --- Non-secret environment variables ---
  # These are typically safe to include directly, especially NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables
  # needed by the client-side Firebase SDK (Next.js embeds these during build).
  # Defining them here also makes them available server-side if needed.
